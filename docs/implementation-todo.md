#### 4b. Header open / commit controls
- [x] Implement `workspace.commit`

  - branch control in the composer git surface is still display-only
  - [ ] Feed pre-commit hook / formatter / lint errors back into the main Pi agent flow instead of treating them as opaque git failures

- [x] Split the composer surface into smaller prompt-vs-git-ops mock states before reworking git UX
  - files: `src/app/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`, `src/app/components/workspace/composer/*`
- [ ] Finish the composer-adjacent git ops replacement surface and align it with the current backend wiring
  - files: `src/app/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`, `src/app/components/workspace/composer/*`
- [ ] Replace per-turn checkpoint diff ownership with a git-native project/worktree diff model if the mock lands well

  - files: `desktop/pi-threads/session-watch.cts`, `desktop/pi-threads/thread-loader.cts`, `desktop/runtime/thread-publisher.cts`, `shared/desktop-contracts.ts`, `src/app/app-shell/useAppShellController.ts`, `src/electron/main/index.ts`

#### 8. Sidebar utility controls
- [ ] Finish thread filtering/search as a coherent end-to-end flow
  - current sidebar + inbox filtering/search is renderer-local only
- [ ] Finish add/import project flow UX + semantics
  - `project.add`, `projects.import.scan`, and `projects.import.apply` are already wired; remaining work is product behavior/polish
- [x] Add drag-and-drop project reordering with persisted sidebar order
- [ ] Extend drag-and-drop to thread-level ordering only if thread ordering semantics become explicit
  - files: `src/app/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/app/state/workspace.ts`, `desktop/pi-threads/action-router.cts`

  - files: `src/app/features/skills/*`, `src/app/features/extensions/*`, `desktop/skills/*`, `desktop/pi-packages/*`
- [ ] Keep polishing scoped-project behavior, empty/error states, and skill-creator packaging details

#### 11. Connections / settings shell items
- [ ] Revisit post-MVP settings surfaces like rate limits remaining
  - files: `src/app/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`, `src/app/components/sidebar/SettingsMenu.tsx`

## Checklist by layer

### Electron / desktop backend checklist

- [x] Add real send-thread desktop bridge requests
- [x] Add real stop/dequeue composer action handling
- [x] Add real new-thread desktop bridge requests
- [x] Add stream/event desktop bridge messages for assistant output
- [x] Replace generic `project.actions` stubs with explicit typed project actions for supported menu items
- [x] Implement PTY-backed terminal backend
- [ ] Decide whether a separate run-log backend/product mode is still needed
- [ ] Implement filter/search backend if needed
- [x] Add backend handlers for project create/import flow
- [ ] Expand session parsing beyond simplified user/assistant mapping
- [ ] Add DB migrations/versioning for future schema changes

Key files:
- `src/electron/main/index.ts`
- `shared/desktop-ipc.ts`
- `src/electron/preload/create-desktop-api.ts`
- `desktop/pi-threads/*`
- `desktop/terminal/*`
- `desktop/runtime/*`
- `desktop/thread-state-db/*`

### Renderer / app-state checklist

- [x] Add controlled composer state
- [x] Add optimistic / streaming thread UI state
- [x] Refresh shell + thread state coherently after mutations
- [ ] Finish thread filter/search UX and semantics beyond the current renderer-local filtering
- [x] Add real skills/extensions feature lanes
- [ ] Add richer thread block renderers

#### 7a. Thread naming from compaction summaries
- [ ] Rename thread titles from compaction summaries instead of leaving them as first-user-message truncations
- [ ] Trigger the rename only when a new compaction is detected so we avoid recomputing titles on ordinary thread updates
- [ ] Keep the rename path lightweight; if needed, use a very short Pi prompt or a custom compaction extension/addon that emits a dedicated `thread name` string alongside the summary
  - likely files: `shared/pi-message-mapper.ts`, `shared/thread-data.ts`, `desktop/runtime/thread-publisher.cts`, `desktop/pi-threads/thread-loader.cts`, and any future Pi extension/addon hook

#### 7b. Inbox
- [x] Ship the persisted inbox mailbox flow in the app shell
- [ ] Finish the remaining supporting feature work around it; inbox itself is now functionally useful but still partial because it depends on surrounding thread/product features that are still in flight

Key files:
- `src/app/AppShell.tsx`
- `src/app/app-shell/*`
- `src/app/hooks/useDesktopShell.ts`
- `src/app/hooks/useDesktopThread.ts`
- `src/app/state/workspace.ts`
- `src/app/components/workspace/Composer.tsx`
- `src/app/components/workspace/composer/*`
- `src/app/views/ThreadView.tsx`

### Sidebar / navigation checklist

- [x] Real new thread creation
- [ ] Finish project add/import flow UX + semantics
- [ ] Finish thread filtering/search semantics beyond the current local filtering
- [x] Drag-and-drop project reordering
- [ ] Optional thread-level drag-and-drop only if thread ordering becomes a real product rule
- [x] Real project action menu operations except worktree creation
- [x] Real landing project picker

### Routing / navigation note

- [ ] Revisit router adoption only when thread/diff/settings state clearly deserves deep-linkable route/search-param ownership
- [ ] Do not add a router just for structure; add it when it materially improves navigation semantics

Key files:
- `src/app/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/app/components/sidebar/ProjectTree.tsx`
- `src/app/components/sidebar/ProjectActionMenu.tsx`
- `src/app/components/sidebar/project-tree/*`
- `src/app/views/LandingView.tsx`

### SQLite / persistence checklist

- [ ] Add schema migration/version strategy
- [ ] Decide project lifecycle rules in DB
- [ ] Decide when sessions are imported vs refreshed
- [ ] Add explicit restore/delete/archive audit fields if needed
- [ ] Add thread send/update write-through rules
- [ ] Add indexes only after real usage patterns are confirmed

Key files:
- `desktop/thread-state-db/*`
- `desktop/pi-threads/*`

## Recommended next milestone

### Milestone: "Real Pi composer"

Definition of done:

- [x] Clicking send on a new thread creates a real Pi session
- [x] Clicking send on an existing thread appends to the real Pi session
- [x] Assistant output appears in the thread UI
- [x] Sidebar updates recency/title/thread presence correctly
- [x] SQLite stays the local index/cache, not the source of truth for actual Pi conversation content

This milestone is now in place. Project actions, terminal, diff rendering, dictation, inbox, and skills/extensions have all moved materially beyond the original mock audit. Next, converge git/diff/review, finish execution-location semantics, and remove or define the remaining mock product surfaces.

## Hardening progress snapshot

- [x] Shared Pi message/title mapping extracted to `shared/pi-message-mapper.ts`
- [x] SQLite layer split into `desktop/thread-state-db/*`
- [x] Pi runtime split into `desktop/runtime/*`
- [x] Pi thread loader/router split into `desktop/pi-threads/*`
- [x] App shell split into `src/app/app-shell/*`
- [x] Composer split into `src/app/components/workspace/composer/*`
- [x] Project tree split into `src/app/components/sidebar/project-tree/*`
- [x] Desktop action coverage made explicit in `shared/desktop-action-coverage.ts`
- [x] Deterministic tests added for shared mapping and payload parsing under `src/test/*`
